## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have these tools installed on your development machine:

**Node.js (version 18 or higher)**: This provides the JavaScript runtime and npm package manager. Download from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

**Git**: Version control system for managing your code. Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).

**Netlify CLI**: Command-line tool for local development and deployment. Install with `npm install -g netlify-cli`.

**AI API Keys**: You'll need API keys from at least one AI provider:
- OpenAI API key from [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com)
- Anthropic API key from [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com)

### Step 1: Project Setup

Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it:

```bash
mkdir prompt-to-profits-ai
cd prompt-to-profits-ai
```

Initialize a new React application:

```bash
npx create-react-app . --template typescript
```

Install the additional dependencies your application needs:

```bash
npm install axios lucide-react
npm install --save-dev @netlify/functions @types/node
```

### Step 2: File Structure Creation

Create the necessary directories for your serverless functions:

```bash
mkdir -p netlify/functions
mkdir -p src/components
```

Now you'll need to create all the files I've provided above. Copy each file to its appropriate location:

- Copy `package.json` to the project root
- Copy `src/App.js` to replace the default React App component
- Copy `src/App.css` to provide the styling
- Copy `netlify/functions/generate-content.mts` for AI content generation
- Copy `netlify/functions/health-check.mts` for system monitoring
- Copy `netlify.toml` for deployment configuration
- Copy `.gitignore` for version control security
- Copy `.env.example` as a template for environment variables

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

Create your local environment file by copying the template:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` and add your actual API keys:

```bash
# Replace these with your real API keys
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-actual-openai-key-here
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-actual-anthropic-key-here
```

**Important Security Note**: Never commit the `.env.local` file to version control. It contains sensitive credentials that should remain private.

### Step 4: Local Development

Start your development environment using Netlify's development server:

```bash
netlify dev
```

This command starts both your React application and the serverless functions, creating a complete local development environment. Your application will be available at `http://localhost:8888`.

The Netlify development server provides several advantages over the standard React development server: it includes your serverless functions, simulates the production environment more accurately, and enables testing of the complete user journey from frontend to backend.
